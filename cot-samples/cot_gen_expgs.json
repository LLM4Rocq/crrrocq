The goal is to prove that there exists a natural number `n` such that the group generated by a set `A` is equal to a certain power of the set `(1 |: A)`.\n\nThe statement is:\n```\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\n|-{n : nat | <<A>> = (1 |: A) ^+ n}\n```\n\nHere `<<A>>` denotes the subgroup generated by `A`, and `(1 |: A)` seems to be the union of the singleton set containing the identity element `1` and the set `A`. The notation `^+ n` is likely the n-fold product of a set with itself.\n\nLet me approach this by first setting some convenient notation. It seems natural to define `B := 1 |: A` and then try to find an `n` such that `<<A>> = B^+n`.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nset B := (1 |: A); pose N := #|gT|.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\n|-{n : nat | <<A>> = B ^+ n}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I've defined `B := 1 |: A` (the union of 1 and A) and set `N := #|gT|` (the order of the finite group). \n\nTo proceed, I need to establish some properties about the relationship between `B^+n` and `<<A>>`. One key property is that for any `n`, `B^+n` is a subset of `<<A>>`. This makes sense because `B` contains `A` and the identity, so any product of elements from `B` will be in the group generated by `A`.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave BsubG n : B ^+ n \\subset <<A>>.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\nn  : nat\n|-B ^+ n \\subset <<A>>\nGoal 1\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\nBsubG  : forall n : nat, B ^+ n \\subset <<A>>\n|-{n : nat | <<A>> = B ^+ n}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nI need to prove that `B^+n` is a subset of `<<A>>` for any natural number `n`. This is a key step because it will later allow us to establish equality by also showing the reverse containment.\n\nThis seems like a perfect candidate for induction on `n`. For the base case, we should have `B^+0 = 1`, which is clearly a subset of any group, including `<<A>>`. For the inductive step, we need to show that if `B^+n` is a subset of `<<A>>`, then so is `B^+(n+1) = B^+n * B`.\n\nLet's search for some lemmas that might help with this induction proof.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about subset of generated group, union of sets, and multiplication in groups.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nsubset_gen:  forall A, A \\subset <<A>>\n\nsubUset:  forall (T : finType) (A B C : {set T}),\n       (B :|: C \\subset A) = (B \\subset A) && (C \\subset A)\n\nmul_subG:  forall (gT : finGroupType) (G : {group gT}) (A B : {set gT}),\n       A \\subset G -> B \\subset G -> A * B \\subset G\n\nexpgS:  forall (T : baseFinGroupType) (x : T) (n : nat),\n       x ^+ n.+1 = x * x ^+ n\n\nsub1G:  forall (gT : finGroupType) (G : {group gT}), 1 \\subset G\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search results provide several useful lemmas:\n\n1. `subset_gen` states that any set is a subset of the group it generates.\n2. `subUset` allows us to decompose a union of sets in a subset relation.\n3. `mul_subG` states that if two sets are subsets of a group, then their product is also a subset of that group.\n4. `expgS` gives us a recurrence relation for exponentiation, showing that `x^(n+1) = x * x^n`.\n5. `sub1G` states that the identity element is a subset of any group.\n\nThese lemmas are perfect for proving our property by induction. For the base case (n=0), we need to show `B^+0 \\subset <<A>>`. For the inductive case, we use `expgS` to rewrite `B^+(n+1)` as `B * B^+n`, and then use `mul_subG` to show it's a subset of `<<A>>`.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby elim: n => [|n IHn]; rewrite ?expgS ?mul_subG ?subUset ?sub1G ?subset_gen.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\nBsubG  : forall n : nat, B ^+ n \\subset <<A>>\n|-{n : nat | <<A>> = B ^+ n}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nGreat, I've proven that for all `n`, `B^+n \\subset <<A>>`.

For the inductive step, I'll use `expgS` to rewrite `B^+(n+1)` as `B * B^+n`, then use `mulUg` to distribute the multiplication, and finally use `mul1g` to simplify.

For all `n`, `B^+n \\subset <<A>>` (from `BsubG`)\n2. For all `n`, `1 \\in B^+n` (from `B_1`)\n\nThe next step is to find a specific value of `n` such that `<<A>> = B^+n`. The fact that we defined `N := #|gT|` (the order of the group) suggests that there's some connection to this value.\n\nLet's try to use the pigeonhole principle. Since the group `gT` is finite with order `N`, there must be some repetition in the sequence `B^+1`, `B^+2`, ..., `B^+N`. If we find the first repetition, that might give us our answer.\n\nI'll use `pickP` to find the smallest index `i` such that `B^+(i+1) \\subset B^+i`, which would imply that `B^+(i+1) = B^+i` (since `B^+i \\subset B^+(i+1)` always holds).\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to selecting elements from finite types.\n</search>\n\n<result>\npickP:  forall (T : finType) (P : pred T), pick_spec P [pick x | P x ]\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe `pickP` lemma will allow me to select an element that satisfies a given predicate, if such an element exists.

This case is handled by `no_fix`.\n\nLet's focus on the first case. To prove `<<A>> = B^+n`, I need to establish that:\n- `<<A>> \\subset B^+n` (the reverse of what we already know from `BsubG`)\n- `B^+n \\subset <<A>>` (already established by `BsubG`)\n\nLet me search for lemmas that can help establish equality of sets.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to set equality and subset relationships.\n</search>\n\n<result>\neqEsubset:  forall (T : finType) (A B : {set T}),\n       (A == B) = (A \\subset B) && (B \\subset A)\n\neqP:  reflect (?x = ?y) (?x == ?y)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- eqType]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n?y : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n\nandbT:  right_id true andb\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe `eqEsubset` lemma is perfect for our needs.

One approach is to use the fact that `B^+n` contains `A` and is a group.

This is captured by the hypothesis `no_fix`.\n\nIn this case, I need to show that there still exists an `n` such that `<<A>> = B^+n`. One approach is to consider `B^+N`, where `N` is the order of the group.\n\nThe idea is to show that if there's no `i < N` such that `B^+(i+1) \\subset B^+i`, then the sequence `B^+1`, `B^+2`, ..., `B^+N` must contain strictly increasing sets. But since the group is finite with order `N`, this would imply that `B^+N` must be the entire group or at least large enough that it can't be strictly contained in any larger set. This could lead to a contradiction unless `B^+N = <<A>>`.\n\nLet me try to formalize this approach.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to comparing cardinalities and maximum cardinalities in finite types.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nltnNge:  forall m n : nat, (m < n) = ~~ (n <= m)\n\nmax_card:  forall (T : finType) (A : {pred T}), #|A| <= #|T|\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe lemmas `ltnNge` and `max_card` will be useful. My strategy is to argue by contradiction: if all sets in the sequence are strictly increasing in size, then `#|B^+N|` would be greater than `N`, which contradicts the fact that no set can have cardinality greater than the cardinality of the whole type (from `max_card`).\n\nSo my first step is to show that `N < #|B^+N|`, which would lead to a contradiction and force `no_fix` to be false, contradicting our assumption.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nsuffices: N < #|B ^+ N| by rewrite ltnNge max_card.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\nBsubG  : forall n : nat, B ^+ n \\subset <<A>>\nB_1  : forall n : nat, 1 \\in B ^+ n\nno_fix  : (fun i : 'I_N => B ^+ i.+1 \\subset B ^+ i) =1 xpred0\n|-N < #|B ^+ N|\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I need to prove that `N < #|B^+N|`. The idea is to show that the sequence `B^+1`, `B^+2`, ..., `B^+N` has strictly increasing cardinalities, and since `B^+1` has cardinality at least 1 (since it contains at least the identity), we must have `#|B^+N| > N`.\n\nLet me search for tools to help with this proof.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to unary natural numbers and upper bounds.\n</search>\n\n<result>\ncards1:  forall (T : finType) (x : T), #|[set x]| = 1\n\nubnPgeq:  forall m : nat, ubn_geq_spec m m\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe lemma `ubnPgeq` seems relevant for working with upper bounds. I can use it to decompose `N` and then use induction to establish the relation between `n` and `#|B^+n|`.\n\nFor the base case, I need to show that `1 < #|B^+1|`. Since `B^+1 = B = 1 |: A`, if `A` is non-empty, then `#|B^+1| > 1`. But if `A` is empty, then `B^+1 = {1}`, which has cardinality 1, not greater than 1. However, in this case, `<<A>> = {1}` as well, so we can handle this as a special case. For now, let's just assume `A` is non-empty and proceed with the induction.\n\nFor the inductive step, I need to show that if `n < #|B^+n|`, then `n+1 < #|B^+(n+1)|`. This follows from the strict inclusion `B^+n \\subset B^+(n+1)` (the negation of `B^+(n+1) \\subset B^+n`), which implies `#|B^+n| < #|B^+(n+1)|`.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave [] := ubnPgeq N; elim=> [|n IHn] lt_nN; first by rewrite cards1.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nB := 1 |: A : {set gT}\nN := #|gT| : nat\nBsubG  : forall n0 : nat, B ^+ n0 \\subset <<A>>\nB_1  : forall n0 : nat, 1 \\in B ^+ n0\nno_fix  : (fun i : 'I_N => B ^+ i.+1 \\subset B ^+ i) =1 xpred0\nn  : nat\nIHn  : n <= N -> n < #|B ^+ n|\nlt_nN  : n < N\n|-n.+1 < #|B ^+ n.+1|\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I need to prove that `n+1 < #|B^+(n+1)|` given that `n < #|B^+n|` (by `IHn`) and `n < N` (by `lt_nN`).\n\nMy strategy is to use transitivity of the less-than relation. Since `n < #|B^+n|` (by `IHn`) and `#|B^+n| < #|B^+(n+1)|` (because `B^+n \\proper B^+(n+1)`), we get `n < #|B^+(n+1)|`. Then, we can argue that `n+1 <= n+1 => n+1 < #|B^+(n+1)|+1`. But we need to prove `#|B^+n| < #|B^+(n+1)|` first.\n\nLet me search for lemmas related to strict inequality between set cardinalities.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to comparing cardinalities of sets, strict subsets, and transitivity of inequalities.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nleq_ltn_trans:  forall n m p : nat, m <= n -> n < p -> m < p\n\nltnW:  forall m n : nat, m < n -> m <= n\n\nproper_card:  forall (T : finType) (A B : {pred T}), A \\proper B -> #|A| < #|B|\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe lemmas are exactly what I need:\n\n1. `leq_ltn_trans` allows for transitive reasoning with `<=` and `<`.\n2. `ltnW` converts `<` to `<=`.\n3. `proper_card` states that if `A` is a proper subset of `B`, then the cardinality of `A` is strictly less than the cardinality of `B`.\n\nMy plan is to use `leq_ltn_trans` with the inductive hypothesis `n < #|B^+n|` to conclude that `n+1 < #|B^+(n+1)|`, provided I can show that `#|B^+n| < #|B^+(n+1)|`. This latter claim follows from `proper_card` if I can show that `B^+n \\proper B^+(n+1)`.\n\nThe hypothesis `no_fix` states that for all `i < N`, `B^+(i+1) \\not\\subset B^+i`.

We know that `B^+n \\subset B^+(n+1)` (because `B^+(n+1) = B^+n * B` and `1 \\in B`). \n\nTo show that `B^+n != B^+(n+1)`, I can use the hypothesis `no_fix`, which states that for all `i < N`, `B^+(i+1) \\not\\subset B^+i`. Since `n < N` (by `lt_nN`), we have `B^+(n+1) \\not\\subset B^+n`. If `B^+n = B^+(n+1)`, then `B^+(n+1) \\subset B^+n`, which contradicts `no_fix`.

Both cases are handled, and we have successfully proved that there exists an `n` such that `<<A>> = B^+n`. This completes the proof of the main theorem.\n\nLet me summarize the key steps of the proof:\n\n1. We defined `B := 1 |: A` and `N := #|gT|`.\n2. We proved that for all `n`, `B^+n \\subset <<A>>` and `1 \\in B^+n`.\n3. We used a case analysis based on whether there exists an `i < N` such that `B^+(i+1) \\subset B^+i`.\n4. In the first case, where such an `i` exists, we showed that `<<A>> = B^+i` by proving both subset relations. The key insight was to show that `B^+i` is a group, so `<<B^+i>> = B^+i`, and since `A \\subset B^+i`, we have `<<A>> \\subset <<B^+i>> = B^+i`.\n5. In the second case, where no such `i` exists, we derived a contradiction by showing that the strict inclusions `B^+1 \\proper B^+2 \\proper ... \\proper B^+N` would imply `#|B^+N| > N`, which can't be true for a finite group with `#|gT| = N`.\n\nThus, there always exists an `n` such that `<<A>> = B^+n`.\n</think>", 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 8818, 'completion_tokens': 11502, 'total_tokens': 20320}}
