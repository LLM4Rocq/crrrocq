This means we need to establish equivalence between the statement \"G and H commute\" and \"G * H is a group\".\n\nTo understand what \"commute G H\" means, I need to recall that in group theory, two groups G and H commute if G * H = H * G. The reflect predicate is used in SSReflect to establish a bidirectional connection between a boolean expression and a proposition.\n\nSo our goal is to show that G and H commute (G * H = H * G) if and only if G * H forms a group (i.e., group_set (G * H) is true). For a set to be a group, it needs to be closed under the group operation and inverses.\n\nLet\\'s first examine what `group_set (G * H)` means mathematically.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nWhat is the definition of group_set in SSReflect?\n</search>\n\n<result>\nsubsetP:  reflect {subset ?A <= ?B} (?A \\subset ?B)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- finType]\n?A : [gT : finGroupType |- {pred ?T}]\n?B : [gT : finGroupType |- {pred ?T}]\n\nmulG_subl:  forall G A, A \\subset A * G\n\ngroup_set:  {set ?gT} -> bool\nwhere\n?gT : [gT : finGroupType |- finGroupType]\n\ngroup1:  forall G, 1 \\in G\n\nandbC:  commutative andb\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search results give me some useful lemmas but I would still like to understand what `group_set` actually evaluates to. From my knowledge of group theory and SSReflect, I would expect that a set S is a group if:\n1. It contains the identity: 1 ∈ S\n2. It\\'s closed under the group operation: ∀ x, y ∈ S, xy ∈ S\n3. It\\'s closed under inverses: ∀ x ∈ S, x^(-1) ∈ S\n\nLet\\'s try to approach this problem by unfolding the definition of `group_set` and working incrementally.\n\nThe lemmas provided in the search can help us:\n- `subsetP` relates subset inclusion as a boolean operation to the corresponding proposition\n- `mulG_subl` says that A is a subset of A * G\n- `group1` states that the identity element is in any group\n- `andbC` states that the boolean and operation is commutative\n\nLet me start by unfolding the definition of `group_set` and applying some of these lemmas.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nrewrite /group_set (subsetP (mulG_subl _ _)) ?group1 // andbC.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nG, H  : {group gT}\n|-reflect (commute G H) ((G * H * (G * H) \\subset G * H) && true)\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I see that the goal has been transformed. After the rewrite operation:\n- First, I\\'ve unfolded the definition of `group_set`\n- Then I used `subsetP` with `mulG_subl` to handle one part of the group closure requirement\n- And `?group1 //` seems to have handled the identity element requirement\n- Finally, `andbC` has reordered the boolean conjunction\n\nThe current goal is to show:\n`reflect (commute G H) ((G * H * (G * H) \\subset G * H) && true)`\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n`reflect (commute G H) (G * H * (G * H) \\subset G * H)`\n\nSo I now need to establish the equivalence between:\n1. G and H commute (G * H = H * G)\n2. G * H is closed under the group operation ((G * H) * (G * H) ⊆ G * H)\n\nBut something seems missing here. For a set to be a group, we also need closure under inverses. I need to incorporate this aspect into the proof. I should check if there are lemmas about inversions in groups.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to group inverses and cardinality.\n</search>\n\n<result>\ninvMG:  forall G H, (G * H)^-1 = H * G\n\ncard_invg:  forall (gT : baseFinGroupType) (A : {set gT}), #|A^-1| = #|A|\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search results gave me some valuable lemmas:\n\n1. `invMG`: This lemma states that (G * H)^(-1) = H * G. This is exactly what I need! It directly connects the inverse of the product to the commutation of the groups.\n\n2. `card_invg`: This lemma states that the cardinality of the set of inverses equals the cardinality of the original set.\n\nThese lemmas suggest a strategy: I can use `invMG` to relate the commutativity of G and H to the structure of the inverse set. Then if G * H is indeed a group, it must be closed under inverses, meaning (G * H)^(-1) ⊆ G * H.\n\nIf G and H commute, then (G * H)^(-1) = H * G = G * H, which satisfies this closure.\n\nI\\'ll continue by introducing the fact that #|G * H| ≤ #|H * G|, which is true because the inverse operation preserves cardinality.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave <-: #|G * H| <= #|H * G| by rewrite -invMG card_invg.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nG, H  : {group gT}\n|-reflect (commute G H)\n  ((G * H * (G * H) \\subset G * H) && (#|G * H| <= #|H * G|))\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow the goal has evolved further. I\\'ve successfully introduced the cardinality comparison: #|G * H| ≤ #|H * G|.\n\nThe current goal is:\n`reflect (commute G H) ((G * H * (G * H) \\subset G * H) && (#|G * H| <= #|H * G|))`\n\nI\\'m building towards showing that G * H is a group if and only if G and H commute. I\\'ve addressed:\n1. Closure under operation: (G * H) * (G * H) ⊆ G * H\n2. A cardinality relation between G * H and H * G\n\nNow I need to continue by establishing the equivalence with the commutativity condition. Let\\'s search for more lemmas that might help with this.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to group multiplication, associativity, and equality of sets.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulSG:  forall G A B, (A * G \\subset B * G) = (A \\subset B * G)\n\nmulgA:  forall T : baseFinGroupType, associative mulg\n\neqEcard:  forall (T : finType) (A B : {set T}),\n       (A == B) = (A \\subset B) && (#|B| <= #|A|)\n\neqP:  reflect (?x = ?y) (?x == ?y)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- eqType]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n?y : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n\neq_sym:  forall (T : eqType) (x y : T), (x == y) = (y == x)\n\nmulGS:  forall G A B, (G * A \\subset G * B) = (A \\subset G * B)\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search results provided more useful lemmas:\n\n1. `mulSG` and `mulGS`: These lemmas help with manipulating subset relations involving group multiplication.\n\n2. `mulgA`: This states that group multiplication is associative, which will help manipulate expressions like (G * H) * (G * H).\n\n3. `eqEcard`: This is particularly interesting as it relates set equality to subset inclusion and cardinality comparison. Specifically, A == B if and only if A ⊆ B and |B| ≤ |A|.\n\n4. `eqP`: This lemma relates the propositional equality (=) to the boolean equality (==).\n\n5. `eq_sym`: This lemma states that equality is symmetric.\n\nUsing these lemmas, I can transform the goal to show that G * H = H * G (commutativity) is equivalent to the current boolean expression. The strategy seems to be:\n\n1. Use the fact that (G * H) * (G * H) ⊆ G * H to establish one direction of subset inclusion\n2. Use the cardinality relation #|G * H| ≤ #|H * G| to establish the equality between G * H and H * G\n\nLet me apply these lemmas to reach the conclusion.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby rewrite -mulgA mulGS mulgA mulSG -eqEcard eq_sym; apply: eqP.\n</script>\n\n<result> \nProof finished.\n</result>",
