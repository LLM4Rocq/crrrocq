We want to show that the right cosets of H with respect to G form a partition of the product H * G. \n\nA partition of a set S is a collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets that cover S. In this case, S is H * G, and the subsets are the right cosets of H with elements from G.\n\nTo approach this, I need to understand the relationship between H * G and the right cosets of H with respect to G.\n\nI\'ll need to find lemmas that help establish this relationship.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about subset relationships and group multiplication.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nsubsetP:  reflect {subset ?A <= ?B} (?A \\subset ?B)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- finType]\n?A : [gT : finGroupType |- {pred ?T}]\n?B : [gT : finGroupType |- {pred ?T}]\n\nmulG_subr:  forall (gT : finGroupType) (G : {group gT}) (A : {set gT}),\n       A \\subset G * A\n\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas could be useful. Let\'s see what they tell us:\n\n1. `subsetP` is a reflection lemma that relates the subset relation `\\subset` to the property that every element of one set is in another set.\n2. `mulG_subr` tells us that for any set A and group G, A is a subset of G * A.\n\nGiven the goal, I think these lemmas can help us establish that G is a subset of H * G. This would be a first step in showing the relationship between the set we\'re partitioning (H * G) and the subsets forming the partition (right cosets of H with elements from G).\n\nLet me start by setting H * G as a variable for easier reference, and then show that G is a subset of H * G using the `mulG_subr` lemma.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nset HG := H * G; have sGHG: {subset G <= HG} by apply/subsetP/mulG_subr.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nG, H  : {group gT}\nHG := (H * G)%g : {set gT}\nsGHG  : {subset G <= HG}\n|-partition (rcosets H G) HG\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I\'ve defined HG := H * G and established that G is a subset of HG using the lemmas.\n\nTo prove that the right cosets form a partition, I need to better understand what a "right coset" is in this context.

Each element in HG belongs to exactly one right coset.\n2. The union of all right cosets equals HG.\n\nI think I\'ll try to characterize the elements that belong to the same right coset.

The first is to prove that for any x in HG, the set of elements y in HG such that the right coset of H with x equals the right coset of H with y is exactly the set H :* x (the right coset of H with x).\n\nTo prove this, I need lemmas that relate equality of right cosets to membership in right cosets.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about right coset equality, set membership, and set equality.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nrcoset_eqP:  reflect (?G :* ?x = ?G :* ?y) (?x \\in ?G :* ?y)\nwhere\n?gT : [gT : finGroupType |- finGroupType]\n?G : [gT : finGroupType |- {group ?gT}]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- FinGroup.sort ?gT]\n?y : [gT : finGroupType |- FinGroup.sort ?gT]\n\nrcosetE:  forall (gT : finGroupType) (A : {set gT}) (x : gT),\n       rcoset A x = A :* x\n\neqP:  reflect (?x = ?y) (?x == ?y)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- eqType]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n?y : [gT : finGroupType |- Equality.sort ?T]\n\nsetP:  forall (T : finType) (A B : {set T}), A =i B <-> A = B\n\ninE:  forall gT : finGroupType,\n       (forall x : gT, (x \\in 1%G) = (x == 1)) *\n       (forall T : finType,\n        (forall (T0 : finType) (pA : pred T0) (x : T0),\n         (x \\in finset pA) = pA x) *\n        (forall x a : T, (x \\in [set a]) = (x == a)) *\n        ((forall (T0 : eqType) (x y : T0), (x \\in [:: y]) = (x == y)) *\n         (forall (T0 : eqType) (y : T0) (s : seq T0) (x : T0),\n          (x \\in y :: s) = (x == y) || (x \\in s)) *\n         (forall T0 : Type,\n          (forall (x : T0) (p : pred T0) (amp : applicative_mem_pred p),\n           in_mem x amp = p x) *\n          (forall (x : T0) (p : pred T0) (msp : manifest_simpl_pred p),\n           in_mem x (Mem [eta msp]) = p x) *\n          (forall p : pred T0, [pred x | p x] =1 p))))\n\nsameP:  forall (P : Prop) (b c : bool), reflect P b -> reflect P c -> b = c\n\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas provide exactly what I need to relate equality of right cosets to set membership:\n\n1. `rcoset_eqP` shows that two right cosets are equal if and only if one element is in the right coset of the other.\n2. `rcosetE` tells us that `rcoset A x = A :* x`, which links the `rcoset` function to the `:*` operator.\n3. `eqP` is a reflection lemma for equality.\n4. `setP` gives a condition for set equality based on membership.\n5. `inE` provides rewriting rules for set membership.\n6. `sameP` helps us rewrite between equivalent boolean expressions.\n\nFor the first subgoal, I\'ll try to prove that y is in the set of elements with the same right coset as x if and only if y is in the right coset of x.

This gives me the symmetry property I need.\n3. `mulGS`, `subsetP`, and `sub1set`: These lemmas will help me establish that if y is in H :* x, then y is also in HG.\n\nI\'ll use `rcoset_sym` to rewrite one side of the equation, and then use `andb_idl` to simplify the conjunction. For `andb_idl` to apply, I need to show that `y \\in H :* x` implies `y \\in HG`, which I can do using the other lemmas.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby rewrite rcoset_sym; apply/andb_idl/subsetP; rewrite mulGS sub1set.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nG, H  : {group gT}\nHG := (H * G)%g : {set gT}\nsGHG  : {subset G <= HG}\ndefHx  : forall x : gT, x \\in HG -> [set y in HG | rcoset H x == rcoset H y] = H :* x\n|-partition (rcosets H G) HG\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I\'ve established that if x is in HG, then the set of elements y in HG such that y and x are in the same right coset is exactly the right coset of H with x. \n\nI\'m back to the main goal: proving that the right cosets of H with respect to G form a partition of HG.\n\nI need lemmas about partitions and how they relate to cosets.

It states that for a function f from T to rT, the pre-image partition of f on domain D forms a partition of D. \n\nIn our context, the function would be `rcoset H`, which maps an element x to its right coset H :* x. The domain D would be HG. \n\nI\'ll use this lemma to prove that the pre-image partition of `rcoset H` on HG forms a partition of HG.
