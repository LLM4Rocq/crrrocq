Let's analyze the goal:\n\n```\n{morph invg : x y / x * y >-> y * x}\n```\n\nThis goal is asking to prove that for all `x` and `y` in the group `G`, we have `(x * y)^-1 = y^-1 * x^-1`. This is a fundamental property of group inverses.\n\nI need to think about what techniques might help prove this. I notice we're working in a group, so I should look for lemmas related to group properties, especially those involving the inverse operation.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about group inverse and multiplication\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulVg:  left_inverse 1 invg mulg\n\nmk_invgK:  involutive invg\n\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search results provide two useful lemmas:\n\n1. `mulVg`: This states that `x * x^-1 = 1`, which is the definition of a left inverse in a group. This will be crucial.\n\n2. `mk_invgK`: This states that the inverse function is involutive, meaning `(x^-1)^-1 = x`. This could also be useful.\n\nWith these lemmas, I can start by establishing a basic property that will help with the proof. It looks like I should establish that `x * x^-1 = 1` for any group element x. This is directly given by `mulVg`, but I might need to manipulate it slightly for my specific goal.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave mulgV x: x * x^-1 = 1 by rewrite -{1}[x]mk_invgK mulVg.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\nG  : Type\nlocal_mixin_choice_hasChoice  : hasChoice.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_choice_Choice_isCountable  : Choice_isCountable.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq  : Equality.mixin_of G\nlocal_mixin_fintype_isFinite  : isFinite.axioms_ G local_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq\nfresh_name_2  : isMulGroup.phant_axioms id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant\n  id_phant id_phant\nmulgV  : forall x : G, x * x^-1 = 1\n|-{morph invg : x y / x * y >-> y * x}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I've established the lemma `mulgV` which states that `x * x^-1 = 1` for any group element `x`. This is a standard group property, but now I have it explicitly available in our context.\n\nLet's continue with the main goal. I need to prove that `(x * y)^-1 = y^-1 * x^-1`. I'll need to introduce `x` and `y` and then manipulate the expressions. Since we're dealing with associativity of multiplication, I might need lemmas about associativity and identity elements.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about associativity and identity in groups\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulgA:  associative mulg\n\nmulVg:  left_inverse 1 invg mulg\n\nmul1g:  left_id 1 mulg\n\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe search gives us additional useful lemmas:\n\n1. `mulgA`: This states that multiplication in the group is associative, so `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`. This will help me rearrange terms.\n\n2. `mul1g`: This states that `1` is the left identity element, so `1 * x = x`. This can help with simplifications after applying inverse properties.\n\nNow I can start working on the proof. I'll introduce the variables `x` and `y`, and then I need to show that `(x * y)^-1 = y^-1 * x^-1`.\n\nMy strategy will be to manipulate the left-hand side `(x * y)^-1` and try to transform it into `y^-1 * x^-1`. I'll likely need to use the established inverse property `mulgV` and manipulate terms using associativity.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nmove=> x y /=; rewrite -[y^-1 * _]mul1g -(mulVg (x * y)) -2!mulgA (mulgA y).\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\nG  : Type\nlocal_mixin_choice_hasChoice  : hasChoice.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_choice_Choice_isCountable  : Choice_isCountable.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq  : Equality.mixin_of G\nlocal_mixin_fintype_isFinite  : isFinite.axioms_ G local_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq\nfresh_name_2  : isMulGroup.phant_axioms id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant\n  id_phant id_phant\nmulgV  : forall x0 : G, x0 * x0^-1 = 1\nx, y  : G\n|-(x * y)^-1 = (x * y)^-1 * (x * (y * y^-1 * x^-1))\n</result>\n\n<think>\nAfter the script execution, the goal has been transformed to:\n\n```\n(x * y)^-1 = (x * y)^-1 * (x * (y * y^-1 * x^-1))\n```\n\nThis is an interesting transformation. Let me think about how to proceed. I need to simplify the right-hand side to show it equals the left-hand side.\n\nLooking at the term `(x * (y * y^-1 * x^-1))`, I notice that `y * y^-1 = 1` by our `mulgV` lemma. If I can apply this, the expression would simplify to `x * (1 * x^-1)`, and then using `mul1g` it would become `x * x^-1`, which equals `1` by `mulgV` again.\n\nOnce I've simplified the right side to `(x * y)^-1 * 1`, I can use `mul1g` to show it equals `(x * y)^-1`, which matches the left side.\n\nLet's look for lemmas that can help with these steps.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about simplifying group expressions with inverses and identity\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulgA:  associative mulg\n\nmulVg:  left_inverse 1 invg mulg\n\nmul1g:  left_id 1 mulg\n\n</result>\n\n<think>\nI have the same lemmas as before, which should be sufficient. I'll use:\n- `mulgA` to rearrange the associativity as needed\n- `mulVg` to replace `y * y^-1` and `x * x^-1` with `1`\n- `mul1g` to simplify expressions with the identity\n\nLet me work through the simplification step by step:\n1. Use `mulgA` to rearrange the parentheses for `y * y^-1 * x^-1`\n2. Apply `mulVg` to replace `y * y^-1` with `1`\n3. Use `mul1g` to simplify `1 * x^-1` to `x^-1`\n4. Rearrange again to apply `mulVg` for `x * x^-1`\n5. Final simplification using `mul1g`\n\nThis should allow me to show that the right-hand side simplifies to the left-hand side.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby rewrite mulgV mul1g mulgV -(mulgV (x * y)) mulgA mulVg mul1g.\n</script>\n\n<result> \nProof finished.\n</result>", 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 3838, 'completion_tokens': 2000, 'total_tokens': 5838}}
