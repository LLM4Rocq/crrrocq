This means we need to prove that if y belongs to the cyclic group generated by x, then there exists an i such that y = x^i and i < #[x] (the order of x).\n\nI should try to find a connection between y being in <[x]> and y being expressible as some power of x. This connection seems intuitive: if y is in the group generated by x, then y must be some power of x. But I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me search for lemmas that relate to cycles, trajectories, and indices, as these might help me establish this connection.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about cyclic groups, trajectories, and indices\n</search>\n\n<result>\ncycle_traject:  forall x, <[x]> =i traject (mulg x) 1 #[x]\n\nindex:  ?T -> seq ?T -> nat\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- eqType]\n\ntraject:  (?T -> ?T) -> ?T -> nat -> seq ?T\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- Type]\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas are helpful. Let me analyze them:\n\n1. `cycle_traject` tells us that the cyclic group <[x]> is intensionally equal to the trajectory of multiplying by x, starting from 1 and going up to #[x]. This connects the cycle to a sequence of elements.\n\n2. `index` seems to be a function that gives the index of an element in a sequence.\n\n3. `traject` creates a sequence by iteratively applying a function to a starting value.\n\nSo, if y is in <[x]>, then by `cycle_traject`, y is in the trajectory of x. I can use this to find the specific power of x that equals y.\n\nLet me use these lemmas to rewrite the condition `y \\in <[x]>` and establish a connection to powers of x.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nrewrite cycle_traject; set tx := traject _ _ #[x] => tx_y; pose i := index y tx.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nx, y  : gT\ntx := traject (mulg x) 1 #[x] : seq gT\ntx_y  : y \\in tx\ni := index y tx : nat\n|-{i0 : nat | i0 < #[x] & y = x ^+ i0}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I've rewritten the condition. Our context has changed:\n\n1. `tx` is defined as the trajectory of multiplying by x, starting from 1 and going for #[x] steps.\n2. `tx_y` states that y is in this trajectory.\n3. `i` is defined as the index of y in this trajectory.\n\nWhat I need to prove now is that there exists an i0 such that i0 < #[x] and y = x ^+ i0.\n\nIt seems like the index i I've defined might be the i0 we're looking for. I need to establish two things:\n1. i < #[x]\n2. y = x ^+ i\n\nFor the first part, I should look for lemmas about the size of trajectories and the relationship between indices and membership.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas about the size of trajectories and relationship between indices and membership\n</search>\n\n<result>\nsize_traject:  forall (T : Type) (f : T -> T) (x : T) (n : nat),\n       size (traject f x n) = n\n\nindex_mem:  forall (T : eqType) (x : T) (s : seq T),\n       (index x s < size s) = (x \\in s)\n</result>\n\n<think>\nPerfect! These lemmas will help me establish that i < #[x]:\n\n1. `size_traject` says that the size of a trajectory is equal to the number of steps, which in our case is #[x].\n2. `index_mem` relates membership in a sequence to the index being less than the size of the sequence.\n\nSince we know y \\in tx (from tx_y), by `index_mem`, we have that index y tx < size tx. And by `size_traject`, size tx = #[x]. Therefore, i = index y tx < #[x].\n\nLet me use these lemmas to prove that i < #[x].\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave lt_i_x : i < #[x] by rewrite -index_mem size_traject in tx_y.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nx, y  : gT\ntx := traject (mulg x) 1 #[x] : seq gT\ntx_y  : y \\in tx\ni := index y tx : nat\nlt_i_x  : i < #[x]\n|-{i0 : nat | i0 < #[x] & y = x ^+ i0}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nGreat! I've established that i < #[x]. Now I need to prove that y = x ^+ i.\n\nI need to relate the value at index i in the trajectory to the power x ^+ i.

This will let me relate y to the element at index i in tx.\n\n2. `iteropE` seems to relate iterative operations (like powers) to the iter function.\n\n3. `nth_traject` tells me that the element at position i in a trajectory is the result of iterating the function i times on the starting value.\n\nNow I can put the pieces together:\n- By `nth_index`, nth _ tx i = y (since i is the index of y in tx).\n- By `nth_traject`, nth _ tx i = iter i (mulg x) 1, which should be x^i.\n- And `iteropE` should help me relate iter i (mulg x) 1 to x^i.\n\nSo, I'll try to establish that y = x^i using these lemmas.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby exists i; rewrite // [x ^+ i]iteropE /= -(nth_traject _ lt_i_x) nth_index.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nProof finished.\n</result>", 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 3664, 'completion_tokens': 1814, 'total_tokens': 5478}}
