I'll simulate realistic training data for a model performing mathematical proofs in the MathComp style. I'll create structured reasoning blocks based on the provided proof sequence, showing incremental reasoning aligned with each tactic.

Let's start with the first goal:

<think> I'm looking at this goal about homomorphisms between finite groups. The goal states that if `H \homg G` (H is homomorphic to G) and `G \homg Grp p` (G is homomorphic to Grp p), then `H \homg Grp p` (H is homomorphic to Grp p).
This seems like a transitivity property of the homomorphism relation. To approach this, I should first understand what the \homg relation means exactly. I'll need to look for lemmas that characterize this relation. Something like homgP would be useful to unpack the definition of \homg.

I also need to understand what Grp p represents. It seems to involve a term and a type, so it's likely constructing some group representation. A lemma explaining hom might clarify this.
</think>

<search> Find lemmas related to homomorphism and homg relation between finite groups </search> <result> homgP: reflect (exists f : {morphism ?D >-> ?rT}, f @* ?D = ?C) (?C \homg ?D) where ?rT : [ |- finGroupType] ?aT : [ |- finGroupType] ?C : [ |- {set ?rT}] ?D : [ |- {set ?aT}]
hom:  forall gT, {set gT} -> (term -> type) -> bool
</result>

<think> Perfect! The `homgP` lemma gives me the exact characterization I needed. It says that `?C \homg ?D` means there exists a morphism `f` from `?D` to `?rT` such that `f @* ?D = ?C`, where `f @* ?D` is the image of `?D` under `f`.
So for our case, H \homg G means there exists a morphism h such that h @* G = H. Wait, that doesn't look right based on the types. Let me think about this more carefully...

Actually, the correct reading would be there exists a morphism h from G to rT such that h @* G = H. So h maps from G to the type of H.

For the first step of the proof, I should use homgP to break down the first assumption H \homg G. This will give me a morphism h and the equation h @* G = H. Then, I can focus on what hom means to understand the relationship with Grp p.

Based on the given tactic, I'll use case/homgP to apply the lemma to the first hypothesis. Then, I'll rewrite H using the equation we get. Finally, I'll unfold the definition of hom and simplify the type-level expression p _ to just some type p.
</think>

We need to show that if `sat G 1 env1 p` holds, then `sat (h @* G) 1 env1 p` holds as well. Here, `sat` likely stands for "satisfies" and is related to the evaluation of terms in these groups.
We seem to be dealing with evaluating terms in the context of groups, and we need to relate the evaluation in G with the evaluation in the morphism image h @* G.

I should look for lemmas related to evaluation of terms (eval) and operations on sequences that might be involved in this evaluation, like all and map. The goal seems to be about showing that satisfaction transfers through the morphism h from G to h @* G.
</think>

<search> Find lemmas related to evaluation and mapping of group terms </search> <result> all: pred ?T -> seq ?T -> bool where ?T : [ |- Type]

?T1 : [ |- Type]
?T2 : [ |- Type]

eval:  seq ?gT -> term -> ?gT
where
?gT : [ |- finGroupType]
</result>

<think> These lemmas will be helpful. Let me think about our strategy:
eval seems to evaluate a term in the context of a sequence of group elements
map allows us to transform a sequence by applying a function to each element
all tests if all elements of a sequence satisfy a predicate
I need to relate the evaluation of terms in G to their evaluation in h @* G.

From the tactic, I can see we're going to establish a property about evaluation under the morphism h. Specifically, it looks like we'll prove that if we evaluate a term t using a sequence of elements e all in G, then applying h to the evaluation result is the same as evaluating t using the sequence obtained by applying h to each element of e.

So we'll need to show: eval (map h e) t = h (eval e t) when all elements of e are in G.

This will make a connection between term evaluation in G and in h @* G.
</think>

<script> have evalG e t: all [in G] e -> eval (map h e) t = h (eval e t). </script> <result> Goal 0 rT, gT : finGroupType G : {group gT} h : {morphism G >-> rT} p : type e : seq gT t : term |-all (in_mem^~ (mem G)) e -> eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) Goal 1 rT, gT : finGroupType G : {group gT} h : {morphism G >-> rT} p : type evalG : forall (e : seq gT) (t : term), all (in_mem^~ (mem G)) e -> eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) |-sat G 1 env1 p -> sat (h @* G) 1 env1 p </goal> <think> Now we need to prove the property `evalG`. This lemma is key to connecting evaluation in `G` with evaluation in `h @* G`. From the syntax, I see that: - `[in G]` is a predicate that checks if an element is in `G` - `all [in G] e` checks if all elements of sequence `e` are in `G` - We want to show `eval (map h e) t = h (eval e t)` under this condition
Looking at the tactic, we'll use the proj2 lemma, which extracts the second part of a conjunction. We'll also use induction on the term t. This suggests that eval is defined recursively based on the structure of terms.

I need to prove that if we evaluate a term using a sequence where every element has been mapped through h, we get the same result as first evaluating the term with the original sequence and then applying h to the result.

Since we're using induction, we'll need to handle different cases of term construction.
</think>

<search> Find lemmas related to projections and evaluation </search> <result> proj2: forall A B : Prop, A /\ B -> B
eval:  seq ?gT -> term -> ?gT
where
?gT : [ |- finGroupType]
</result>

<think> The `proj2` lemma will let us extract the second component of a conjunction. We'll use this to focus on the equality part of our goal.
From the tactic, it seems we're going to set up a proof by induction on the term t. We'll show that for any element e of G, we have both:

eval e t \in G (the evaluation stays within G)
eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) (mapping commutes with evaluation)
The first property ensures we maintain the invariant that evaluations stay within G, which is necessary for the morphism properties to apply. The second property is our main goal.

By using proj2, we'll focus on the second property after establishing the first one.

We're performing an induction on the structure of terms, and we need to handle each case:
Variables: nth 1 e n (accessing the nth element of the sequence)
Identity: 1 (the group identity element)
Inverse: (eval e t)^-1 (group element inverse)
Power: eval e t ^+ n (raising to a power)
Multiplication: eval e t * eval e t0 (group operation)
Conjugation: eval e t ^ eval e t0 (conjugation operation)
Commutator: [~ eval e t, eval e t0] (commutator)
For the first case (variables), I need to handle the case where the index is within the bounds of the sequence differently from when it's out of bounds. I'll need lemmas related to nth and sequence sizes.
</think>

<search> Find lemmas related to sequence size and comparison </search> <result> size: seq ?T -> nat where ?T : [ |- Type]
leqP:  forall m n : nat,
leq_xor_gtn m n (minn n m) (minn m n) (maxn n m)
(maxn m n) (m <= n) (n < m)
</result>

<think> Now I see that we'll use `leqP` to case on whether the index is within bounds of the sequence or not. We have two main cases to consider: 1. When `i >= size e`: We're accessing an element beyond the sequence bounds 2. When `i < size e`: We're accessing an element within the sequence
For case 1, we'll need to show that accessing out-of-bounds elements behaves consistently with morphisms.
For case 2, we'll need to show that the morphism property holds for in-bounds elements.

The tactic suggests we'll handle these cases separately.

In many implementations, accessing beyond the bounds returns a default value, which in this case appears to be the group identity element `1`.
I need lemmas that specify the behavior of nth when accessing out of bounds, and lemmas about morphisms preserving the identity element.

<think> These lemmas are exactly what we need:
nth_default confirms that when we access beyond the bounds of a sequence, we get the default value.
morph1 states that morphisms preserve the identity element.
size_map shows that mapping a function over a sequence preserves its size.
For the out-of-bounds case, we'll apply nth_default to show that both nth 1 e i and nth 1 [seq h i | i <- e] i return the identity element 1. Then we'll use morph1 to show that h 1 = 1, proving the equality.

The '!' in the tactic indicates we're applying these lemmas potentially multiple times.

For this case, we need to show: 1. `nth 1 e i \in G` - the element at position i in sequence e is in G 2. `nth 1 [seq h i | i <- e] i = h (nth 1 e i)` - applying h to the element at position i is the same as getting the element at position i in the mapped sequence
For the first part, we need to use the fact that all [in G] e means every element of e is in G.
For the second part, we need a lemma about nth and map.

Looking at the tactic, we'll use several lemmas:

nth_map to relate accessing an element in a mapped sequence to mapping the element at that position
allP to work with the universal property from all [in G] e
mem_nth to establish that indexed access retrieves an element from the sequence </think>
<search> Find lemmas about accessing elements in mapped sequences </search> <result> mem_nth: forall (T : eqType) (x0 : T) (s : seq T) (n : nat), n < size s -> nth x0 s n \in s

(f : T1 -> T2) (n : nat) (s : seq T1),
n < size s -> nth x2 [seq f i | i <- s] n = f (nth x1 s n)

where
?T : [ |- eqType]
?a : [ |- pred ?T]
?s : [ |- seq ?T]
</result>

<think> These lemmas are just what we need:
nth_map shows that accessing an element in a mapped sequence is equivalent to mapping the element at that position in the original sequence.
allP gives us a way to work with the universal property from all [in G] e.
mem_nth establishes that elements accessed by index are indeed members of the sequence.
The tactic uses nth_map with the condition that i < size e (which we have from lt_i_e). Then it uses allP to rewrite the condition all [in G] e to a form that lets us reason about elements in the sequence.

Continue

Edit
I'll continue with the proof simulation for the MathComp mathematical proof:

<think> Now we need to handle the identity element case. We need to show that: 1. `1 \in G` - the identity element is in the group G 2. `1 = h 1` - the morphism preserves the identity element
For the first part, we know that the identity element is always in any group by the group axioms.
For the second part, we can use the morph1 lemma that we saw earlier, which states that any morphism preserves the identity element.

We need to show that: 1. `(eval e t)^-1 \in G` - the inverse of an evaluation result is in G 2. `(eval [seq h i | i <- e] t)^-1 = h (eval e t)^-1` - the inverse of the evaluation in the mapped sequence equals the morphism applied to the inverse of the evaluation in the original sequence
For the first part, we need a lemma that states that if an element is in a group, then its inverse is also in the group.
For the second part, we need a lemma that states that morphisms preserve inverses.

Let me look for those lemmas.
</think>

(f : {morphism D >-> rT}), {in D, {morph f : x / x^-1 >-> x^-1}}
</result>

<think> These lemmas are exactly what we need:
groupV states that an element is in a group if and only if its inverse is in the group.
morphV states that morphisms preserve inverses for elements in the domain.
The tactic destructures the hypothesis eval e t \in G /\ eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) into two parts:

Gt: eval e t \in G - the evaluation result is in G
->: eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) - the mapping commutes with evaluation
Then it applies the lemmas groupV and morphV to prove our goal.

We need to show that: 1. `eval e t ^+ n \in G` - raising the evaluation result to a power n keeps it in G 2. `eval [seq h i | i <- e] t ^+ n = h (eval e t ^+ n)` - the power of the evaluation in the mapped sequence equals the morphism applied to the power of the evaluation in the original sequence
We'll need lemmas about powers in groups and morphisms preserving powers.

The tactic again destructures the hypothesis, and then applies these lemmas to prove our goal. The '?' in ?morphX suggests that the lemma application might need some additional work to match the context.

To make progress, I need to understand what sat means and how it relates to our evalG property. Let me first look for lemmas related to bool and and_rel, as these might be used in the definition of sat.

and_rel:  forall vT : finType, vT -> vT -> rel_type -> rel_type

<think> I see that `and_rel` is a relational operator that combines equality testing with another relation. From the tactic, it looks like we'll define a lemma that characterizes `and_rel` in terms of boolean operations. I'm guessing that `and_rel` is used in the definition of `sat`.
The tactic suggests we'll establish that and_rel x1 x2 r = (x1 == x2) && r, indicating that and_rel tests equality between x1 and x2 and combines it with the relation r.

<think> Now I understand a bit more about what's happening. It seems that: - `rel` constructs a relation based on a sequence, a formula, and a base relation - `NoRel` is a base relation, possibly representing "no relation" or a trivial relation - The tactic suggests we'll establish a lemma `rsatG` stating that if all elements of `e` are in `G`, then a relation under `e` is preserved when mapping through `h`
This should help us connect sat G 1 env1 p to sat (h @* G) 1 env1 p.

Continue

Edit
I'll continue with the proof simulation for the MathComp mathematical proof:

<think> Now we need to perform induction on the formula `f` to prove our lemma. The tactic suggests we'll use case analysis on the structure of formulas. From the resulting goals, it looks like formulas can be built from basic equality tests (`Eq2 x1 x2`) and compound formulas.
Our strategy is to use induction to handle the structure of formulas, and in the base case (Eq2 x1 x2), we'll relate the evaluation of these terms using our evalG lemma.
</think>

We need to show that if this relation holds in the original sequence `e`, it also holds in the mapped sequence `map h e`.
We'll need lemmas about equality testing (eqxx), logical conjunction (andP), and equality reflection (eqP).
</think>

<search> Find lemmas related to equality testing and logical operations </search> <result> eqxx: forall (T : eqType) (x : T), x == x

eqP:  reflect (?x = ?y) (?x == ?y)
where
?T : [ |- eqType]
?x : [ |- Equality.sort ?T]
?y : [ |- Equality.sort ?T]
</result>

<think> These lemmas will help us handle the equality test case:
eqxx states that any element is equal to itself using the == operator.
andP relates a boolean conjunction b1 && b2 to the logical conjunction b1 /\ b2.
eqP relates equality testing x == y to the logical equality x = y.
Looking at the tactic, we'll use these lemmas along with and_relE and evalG to handle the base case of formula induction.

We've established the `rsatG` lemma, which relates relations in the original sequence to relations in the mapped sequence. Now we need to use this to prove our main goal about satisfaction.
It seems we'll need to better understand the types and operations involved in sat and env1. Let me search for information about finType and env1.
</think>

<search> Find information about finType and env1 </search> <result> finType: Type
env1:  ?gT -> env ?gT
where
?gT : [ |- finGroupType]
</result>

<think> Now I have a better understanding. `finType` is a type for finite types, and `env1` constructs an environment for a given finGroupType. The tactic suggests we'll set up some convenient notation to make the proof easier to follow. We'll define: - `s` as `env1` for `gT` - `vT` as `gT` viewed as a `finType`
This will help us specialize the environment construction for the specific types we're working with.
</think>

<script> set s := env1; set vT := gT : finType in s *. </script> <result> Goal 0 rT, gT : finGroupType G : {group gT} h : {morphism G >-> rT} p : type evalG : forall (e : seq gT) (t : term), all (in_mem^~ (mem G)) e -> eval [seq h i | i <- e] t = h (eval e t) and_relE : forall (xT : finType) (x1 x2 : xT) (r : rel_type), and_rel x1 x2 r = (x1 == x2) && r rsatG : forall (e : seq gT) (f : formula), all (in_mem^~ (mem G)) e -> rel e f NoRel -> rel [seq h i | i <- e] f NoRel vT := gT : finType s := env1 : vT -> env gT |-sat G 1 s p -> sat (h @* G) 1 env1 p </result> <think> Now we'll do a similar thing for `rT`. We'll define: - `s'` as `env1` for `rT` - `vT'` as `rT` viewed as a `finType`
This parallel notation will help us reason about the environments for both the domain and codomain of our morphism.

Env:  forall gT, {set gT} -> seq gT -> env gT
</result>

<think> Now I understand better. `Env` is the constructor that creates an environment from a set and a sequence of group elements. The tactic suggests we'll establish a property relating environments constructed for `G` to environments constructed for `h @* G`.
Specifically, for an environment Env A e where A is a subset of G and e is a sequence of elements, we need to show that all elements of e are in G and that there exists an environment for h @* G constructed from the mapped sequence.
</think>

For the specific case of `env1`, which appears to construct environments for single elements, we need to show that the resulting environment satisfies our property.

cycle_subG:  forall gT (x : gT) (G : {group gT}), (<[x]> \subset G) = (x \in G)
</result>

<think> These lemmas are very useful for our proof:
morphim_cycle states that the morphism image of a cyclic group is the cyclic group generated by the image of the generator.
andbT is the right identity property for boolean conjunction, which we've seen before.
cycle_subG relates the subset relation for a cyclic group to membership of the generator in the parent group.
Looking at the tactic, we're using these lemmas to simplify the environment construction. It looks like env1 constructs an environment using a cyclic group, so these lemmas will help us relate env1 for G to env1 for h @* G.

We need to construct a suitable `v'` in `rT` such that `s' v' = Env <[h v]> [:: h v]`. The tactic suggests that we can just use `h v` as this element. We'll use the `split` tactic to handle the conjunction. </think> <search> Find information about split tactic </search> <result> split: 'I_(?m + ?n) -> 'I_?m + 'I_?n where ?m : [ |- nat] ?n : [ |- nat] </result> <think> The `split` tactic is used to break down a conjunction or other suitable goal. In this case, we'll split the conjunction `v \in G /\ (exists v' : rT, s' v' = Env <[h v]> [:: h v])` and then prove each part separately.
From the tactic, it looks like we'll prove the first part trivially (since we already have Gv : v \in G) and for the second part, we'll use h v as the witness for the existential.

The tactic suggests we'll use induction on the type `p`. This makes sense as `p` represents the type of the predicate we're evaluating for satisfaction.
We have two cases to consider:

p applied to a term
A formula f
The induction will allow us to handle these different structures of p.

For the first goal, involving `p (Cst n)`, we'll apply the induction hypothesis `IHp`. For the second goal, involving the formula `f`, we'll need to handle the existential quantifier.
Let's focus on the first goal. Looking at the tactic, we'll apply IHp and then need to handle the environment construction. We'll need to relate environments of the form Env (A <*> <[v.2]>) (v.2 :: e) to the simple environments we've been working with.

We need to show that if `A <*> <[x]> \subset G`, then: 1. `x \in G` and all elements of `e` are in `G` 2. There exists a suitable `v'` in `vT' * rT` such that the corresponding environment matches `Env (h @* (A <*> <[x]>)) (h x :: [seq h i | i <- e])`
We'll need lemmas about joins of subgroups and the subset relation.

Continue

Edit
I'll continue with the proof simulation for the MathComp mathematical proof:

<think> Now that we've simplified our goal, we need to prove two things: 1. `true && all [in G] e` - This simplifies to just proving `all [in G] e` since conjunction with `true` is just the other term. 2. `exists v' : vT' * rT, ...` - We need to find a suitable `v'` in `vT' * rT` that satisfies our requirement.
For the first part, we already have Gs, which gives us all [in G] e when A \subset G, and we've established sAG : A \subset G.

For the second part, we need to construct a suitable v' based on the witness that Gs provides. The tactic suggests we'll use an element of the form (v', h x) where v' is a witness for the existing property.

This requires relating the morphism image of a join to the join of morphism images. We'll also need to relate the morphism image of a cyclic group to the cyclic group generated by the image of the generator. Let me look for lemmas that help with these relations.

<think> These lemmas are exactly what we need:
morphim_cycle relates the morphism image of a cyclic group to the cyclic group generated by the image of the generator.
morphimY relates the morphism image of a join to the join of morphism images.
cycle_subG relates the subset relation for a cyclic group to membership of the generator.
Env is the constructor for environments, which we already know about.
Using these lemmas, we can show that:

h @* (A <*> <[x]>) equals h @* A <*> h @* <[x]> by morphimY
h @* <[x]> equals <[h x]> by morphim_cycle
Therefore, h @* (A <*> <[x]>) equals h @* A <*> <[h x]>

Looking at the tactic, we'll use case/existsP to destructure the hypothesis, and then use Gs to establish the relationship between s v and s' v'.

First, we'll use Gs to get the witness v'. Since A = G and A \subset G trivially holds, we can apply Gs directly.

We'll use existsP to construct the existential and then and_relE to break down the and_rel property. Since A = G, we have h @* A = h @* G, which means h @* A == h @* G is true. Then we need to show that rel (rev [seq h i | i <- e]) f NoRel holds, which follows from rel (rev e) f NoRel using the rsatG property.

We'll use the rsatG lemma, which states that all [in G] e -> rel e f NoRel -> rel (map h e) f NoRel. We know all [in G] e from Ge, and we have rel (rev e) f NoRel from rel_f. So we need to relate rev [seq h i | i <- e] to map h (rev e).

We'll need lemmas about the interaction of rev and map.

eq_all_r:  forall (T : eqType) (s1 s2 : seq T), s1 =i s2 -> all^~ s1 =1 all^~ s2

<think> These lemmas are just what we need:
map_rev relates mapping over a reversed sequence to reversing a mapped sequence: map f (rev s) = rev (map f s).
mem_rev states that membership in a reversed sequence is the same as membership in the original sequence.
eq_all_r relates the all predicate for sequences that have the same elements.
Using these lemmas, we can relate rev [seq h i | i <- e] to [seq h i | i <- rev e] using map_rev, and then use rsatG to relate rel (rev e) f NoRel to rel [seq h i | i <- rev e] f NoRel.

This completes the simulation of reasoning blocks for the MathComp proof. I've shown how to systematically work through each step of the proof, using structured reasoning blocks to capture the thought process and discoveries along the way.

The proof establishes that if H is homomorphic to G, and G is homomorphic to Grp p, then H is homomorphic to Grp p, demonstrating a transitivity property of the homomorphism relation. The proof makes extensive use of group theory concepts including morphisms, cyclic groups, environments, and relational operators.
