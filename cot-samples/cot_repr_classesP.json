We need to prove that for a given subset `xG` of a finite group `gT`, the statement `xG \\in classes G` is equivalent to `repr xG \\in G /\\ xG = repr xG ^: G`. \n\nThe notation `^:` likely denotes a conjugation class, and `repr` seems to be a function that selects a representative from a set. In the goal, we're using the `reflect` predicate which establishes a bidirectional relation between a boolean expression and a logical proposition.\n\nI need to understand how to approach this goal. It seems like we're trying to characterize when a set is an element of `classes G`, which probably represents the set of conjugacy classes of `G`. According to the goal, this happens when `xG` equals the conjugacy class of its representative, and that representative is in `G`.\n\nThe provided `SEARCH` directive shows that we have three lemmas available:\n1. `imsetP` - a lemma about the image of a set under a function\n2. `repr` - a function that selects a representative from a set\n3. `iffP` - a lemma that helps establish bidirectional implications for reflect predicates\n\nGiven these tools, a sensible approach would be to use `iffP` to break down the reflect statement, and then use `imsetP` to handle the image set part of the goal. The `repr` function will be useful for dealing with representatives.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind the definition or properties of the `classes` operator for a group.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nimsetP:  reflect (exists2 x : ?aT, in_mem x ?D & ?y = ?f x)\n         (?y \\in imset ?f ?D)\nwhere\n?aT : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- finType]\n?rT : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- finType]\n?f : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- ?aT -> ?rT]\n?D : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- mem_pred ?aT]\n?y : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- Finite.sort ?rT]\n\nrepr:  {set ?gT} -> ?gT\nwhere\n?gT : [gT : finGroupType  G : {group gT} |- baseFinGroupType]\n\niffP:  forall (P Q : Prop) (b : bool),\n       reflect P b -> (P -> Q) -> (Q -> P) -> reflect Q b\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I need to examine the available lemmas more carefully to determine how to proceed.\n\nThe `imsetP` lemma relates membership in an image set `y \\in imset f D` with the existence of an element `x` in `D` such that `y = f(x)`. This is useful because conjugacy classes are typically defined as image sets.\n\nThe `repr` function extracts a representative element from a set. In this context, it's likely choosing a representative element from the conjugacy class.\n\nThe `iffP` lemma will help us establish the bidirectional implication needed for the `reflect` statement.\n\nI suspect that `classes G` might be defined as the set of all conjugacy classes of elements in `G`. If that's the case, then `xG \\in classes G` means that `xG` is a conjugacy class of some element in `G`, which would align with our goal.\n\nLooking at the provided tactic hint, it starts with `apply: (iffP imsetP) => [[x Gx ->] | []]; last by exists (repr xG).`, which confirms that we're using `iffP` with `imsetP` to break down the `reflect` statement. I'll follow this approach.\n</think>\n\n<script>\napply: (iffP imsetP) => [[x Gx ->] | []]; last by exists (repr xG).\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nG  : {group gT}\nxG  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nGx  : x \\in G\n|-repr (x ^: G) \\in G /\\ x ^: G = repr (x ^: G) ^: G\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow the goal has changed. We've applied the `iffP` lemma with `imsetP`, and we're now working on one direction of the equivalence. \n\nThe current goal is to show that given an element `x` in `G` such that `xG = x ^: G` (which appears to have been substituted in the goal), we need to prove:\n`repr (x ^: G) \\in G /\\ x ^: G = repr (x ^: G) ^: G`\n\nThis splits into two parts:\n1. Showing that the representative of the conjugacy class of `x` is in `G`\n2. Showing that the conjugacy class of `x` equals the conjugacy class of its representative\n\nFor the first part, we need to understand properties of the `repr` function. The representative of a conjugacy class should be an element of the group.\n\nFor the second part, we need properties of conjugacy classes, particularly how they behave under the `repr` function.\n\nIt seems like we might need additional lemmas to make progress. The search tag indicates we should look for `classGidl`, `groupJ`, and `repr_class`.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to representatives of conjugacy classes and properties of conjugacy classes.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nclassGidl:  forall x y, y \\in G -> x ^ y ^: G = x ^: G\n\ngroupJ:  forall x y, x \\in G -> y \\in G -> x ^ y \\in G\n\nrepr_class:  forall x, {y : gT | y \\in G & repr (x ^: G) = x ^ y}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas seem very helpful for our goal:\n\n1. `classGidl`: This states that for `x` and `y` where `y \\in G`, the conjugacy class of `x^y` (where `^` likely denotes conjugation) is the same as the conjugacy class of `x`. This makes sense since conjugacy classes are equivalence classes under conjugation.\n\n2. `groupJ`: This states that if `x` and `y` are in `G`, then `x^y` (the conjugate of `x` by `y`) is also in `G`. This is a basic property of groups.\n\n3. `repr_class`: This is particularly useful. It states that for any element `x`, there exists an element `y` in `G` such that the representative of the conjugacy class of `x` is equal to `x^y`. This directly relates the representative to conjugation.\n\nUsing these lemmas, I can now approach the goal:\n1. Apply `repr_class` to get the relationship between `repr (x ^: G)` and `x^y` for some `y \\in G`\n2. Use `groupJ` to show that `repr (x ^: G) \\in G` (since it's equal to `x^y` where both `x` and `y` are in `G`)\n3. Use `classGidl` to show that `x ^: G = repr (x ^: G) ^: G` (since `repr (x ^: G) = x^y` for some `y \\in G`)\n\nThe suggested tactic is `by have [y Gy ->] := repr_class x; rewrite classGidl ?groupJ.`, which aligns with my reasoning above. It extracts `y` and the property that `repr (x ^: G) = x ^ y` from `repr_class`, then uses `classGidl` and `groupJ` to complete the proof.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby have [y Gy ->] := repr_class x; rewrite classGidl ?groupJ.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nProof finished.\n</result>",
