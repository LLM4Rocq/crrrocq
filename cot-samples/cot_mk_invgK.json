In mathematical terms, this would mean that applying `invg` twice to any element returns the original element, i.e., for any x, (x^-1)^-1 = x.\n\nLooking at the context, I see that we're dealing with a type G that has various properties such as hasChoice, isCountable, hasDecEq, and isFinite. There's also a hypothesis `fresh_name_2` that appears to be related to group properties.\n\nTo prove that `invg` is involutive, I need to show that for any element x in G, (x^-1)^-1 = x. This is a standard property of groups, so I'll likely need to use group axioms or previously proven lemmas.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to group inverse and multiplication.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulgA:  associative mulg\n\nmulVg:  left_inverse 1 invg mulg\n\nmul1g:  left_id 1 mulg\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas are going to be very useful:\n1. `mulgA`: This states that `mulg` (group multiplication) is associative, so (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, c.\n2. `mulVg`: This states that for any element x, x^-1 * x = 1. The inverse of an element multiplied by the element itself gives the identity.\n3. `mul1g`: This states that 1 is a left identity for `mulg`, so 1 * x = x for any x.\n\nNow, I need to figure out a strategy to prove that (x^-1)^-1 = x. One approach could be to show that (x^-1)^-1 * 1 = x, since 1 is the identity element. Let's see if I can manipulate this using the lemmas I have.\n\nIf I start with (x^-1)^-1 * 1, I can try to rewrite this to get to x. I think I might be able to use `mulVg` to introduce x^-1 * x somewhere, then use associativity and other properties to simplify.\n\nLet's try this: \n(x^-1)^-1 * 1 = (x^-1)^-1 * 1\n                = (x^-1)^-1 * (x^-1 * x) (using mulVg to replace 1 with x^-1 * x)\n                = ((x^-1)^-1 * x^-1) * x (using mulgA for associativity)\n                = 1 * x (using mulVg again, as (x^-1)^-1 * x^-1 = 1)\n                = x (using mul1g)\n\nSo, we can show that (x^-1)^-1 * 1 = x. This doesn't directly prove that (x^-1)^-1 = x, but since 1 is the identity, it does imply that.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave mulV21 x: x^-1^-1 * 1 = x by rewrite -(mulVg x) mulgA mulVg mul1g.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\nG  : Type\nlocal_mixin_choice_hasChoice  : hasChoice.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_choice_Choice_isCountable  : Choice_isCountable.axioms_ G\nlocal_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq  : Equality.mixin_of G\nlocal_mixin_fintype_isFinite  : isFinite.axioms_ G local_mixin_eqtype_hasDecEq\nfresh_name_2  : isMulGroup.phant_axioms id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant id_phant\n  id_phant id_phant\nmulV21  : forall x : G, x^-1^-1 * 1 = x\n|-involutive invg\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow that we've proven the lemma `mulV21`, which states that (x^-1)^-1 * 1 = x for any x, we need to use this to prove the original goal: `involutive invg`.\n\nThe definition of `involutive` likely means that applying the function twice returns the original input. In our case, we need to show that for any x, (x^-1)^-1 = x.\n\nGiven that `mulV21` shows (x^-1)^-1 * 1 = x, and since 1 is the identity element (so a * 1 = a for any a), we can derive that (x^-1)^-1 = x. But we might need to make this explicit.\n\nLet's check if there are any other lemmas that might be useful.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to identity element and group operations.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nmulgA:  associative mulg\n\nmul1g:  left_id 1 mulg\n</result>\n\n<think>\nWe have the same lemmas as before:\n1. `mulgA`: This states that `mulg` (group multiplication) is associative.\n2. `mul1g`: This states that 1 is a left identity for `mulg`.\n\nNow, to prove `involutive invg`, I need to show that for any element x in G, (x^-1)^-1 = x.\n\nGiven that `mulV21` shows (x^-1)^-1 * 1 = x, and since 1 is the identity element (so a * 1 = a for any a), we can directly state that (x^-1)^-1 = x.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to rewrite the goal using the lemmas and the `mulV21` lemma. Let's think about this.\n\nOne approach might be:\n1. Start with x^-1.\n2. Apply the lemma `mulV21` to rewrite (x^-1)^-1 * 1 as x^-1.\n3. Use the fact that 1 is the identity element to simplify (x^-1)^-1 * 1 to (x^-1)^-1.\n\nThis should give us the desired result.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby move=> x; rewrite -[_ ^-1]mulV21 -(mul1g 1) mulgA !mulV21.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nProof finished.\n</result>",
