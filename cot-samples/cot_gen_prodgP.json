We\\'re being asked to prove a reflection lemma that relates the membership of an element `x` in the group generated by a set `A` to the existence of a finite product of elements from `A` that equals `x`.\n\nSpecifically, the goal is:\n```\nreflect\n  (exists n : nat,\n     exists2 c : \\'I_n -> gT, forall i : \\'I_n, c i \\in A & x = \\prod_i c i)\n  (x \\in <<A>>)\n```\n\nThis is saying: \"x is in the group generated by A if and only if x can be written as a product of elements from A.\"\n\nI need to establish this bidirectional implication. The `reflect` predicate is used in MathComp to express this kind of bidirectional relationship between boolean expressions and propositions.\n\nTo start, I should look for lemmas that help with handling reflection and if-and-only-if relationships.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to reflection and bidirectional implications.\n</search>\n\n<result>\niffP:  forall (P Q : Prop) (b : bool),\n       reflect P b -> (P -> Q) -> (Q -> P) -> reflect Q b\n\nidP:  reflect ?b1 ?b1\nwhere\n?b1 : [gT : finGroupType |- bool]\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas will be useful. \n\n1. `iffP` allows us to establish a reflection between a boolean `b` and a proposition `Q` if we already have a reflection between `b` and another proposition `P`, and we can prove both `P -> Q` and `Q -> P`.\n\n2. `idP` is a simple reflection that says a boolean `b` reflects itself as a proposition.\n\nI can use these to break down the reflection goal. I\\'ll apply `iffP` with `idP` to transform the goal into proving both directions of the implication. Then I\\'ll handle each direction separately.\n\nFor the first direction, I\\'ll need to show that if `x \\in <<A>>`, then x can be written as a product of elements from A. For the second direction, I\\'ll need to show that if x can be written as a product of elements from A, then `x \\in <<A>>`.\n\nLet\\'s start by applying `iffP` with `idP`:\n</think>\n\n<script>\napply: (iffP idP) => [|[n [c Ac ->]]]; last first.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\nc  : \\'I_n -> gT\nAc  : forall i : \\'I_n, c i \\in A\n|-\\prod_i c i \\in <<A>>\nGoal 1\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\n|-x \\in <<A>> ->\nexists n : nat,\n  exists2 c : \\'I_n -> gT, forall i : \\'I_n, c i \\in A & x = \\prod_i c i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I have two subgoals. I\\'ll tackle the first one first (which was actually the second direction in my initial explanation):\n\nGoal 0: Show that if x is a product of elements from A, then x is in the group generated by A.\n\nFor this goal, I need to prove:\n```\n\\prod_i c i \\in <<A>>\n```\n\nI need to use facts about group products and how they relate to group generation. I should search for lemmas related to products of group elements and membership in generated groups.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to products of group elements and membership in generated groups.\n</search>\n\n<result>\ngroup_prod:  forall (gT : finGroupType) (G : {group gT}) \n         (I : Type) (r : seq I) (P : pred I) (F : I -> gT),\n       (forall i : I, P i -> F i \\in G) -> \\prod_(i <- r | P i) F i \\in G\n\nmem_gen:  forall x A, x \\in A -> x \\in <<A>>\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas are exactly what I need:\n\n1. `group_prod` states that if all components of a product are in a group G, then the product itself is in G.\n\n2. `mem_gen` states that if an element x is in a set A, then x is also in the group generated by A (<<A>>).\n\nI\\'ll use `group_prod` to show that the product is in <<A>> because each individual factor c i is in <<A>>. And I\\'ll use `mem_gen` to show that each c i is in <<A>> because each c i is in A (given by the assumption Ac).\n\nLet me put together a script that uses these lemmas:\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby apply: group_prod => i _; rewrite mem_gen ?Ac.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\n|-x \\in <<A>> ->\nexists n : nat,\n  exists2 c : \\'I_n -> gT, forall i : \\'I_n, c i \\in A & x = \\prod_i c i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I need to prove the second goal (which was actually the first direction in my initial explanation):\n\nGoal: Show that if x is in the group generated by A, then x can be written as a product of elements from A.\n\nThis is the more challenging direction. I need to understand the structure of the group generated by A, and how elements of this group can be represented.\n\nLet\\'s search for lemmas related to the structure of generated groups, particularly those involving exponentiation of sets, as this often appears in characterizations of generated groups.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to the structure of generated groups and exponentiation of sets.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nexpgn:  ?T -> nat -> ?T\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- baseFinGroupType]\n\ngen_expgs:  forall A, {n : nat | <<A>> = (1 |: A) ^+ n}\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas will help:\n\n1. `expgn` seems to be a function for exponentiation.\n\n2. `gen_expgs` is particularly useful as it states that the group generated by A can be expressed as the nth power of the set \"1 |: A\" (which is the set A union with the identity element 1).\n\nI\\'ll use `gen_expgs` to rewrite the group generation in terms of set exponentiation, then work with this representation. First, let\\'s apply `gen_expgs` to get the characterization of <<A>>.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave [n ->] := gen_expgs A; rewrite /expgn Monoid.iteropE /=.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\n|-x \\in iter n (mulg (1 |: A)) 1 ->\nexists n0 : nat,\n  exists2 c : \\'I_n0 -> gT,\n    forall i : \\'I_n0, c i \\in A & x = \\prod_(i < n0) c i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I have the goal rewritten in terms of iteration. We\\'re saying that x is in the n-fold product of the set (1 |: A).\n\nI need to go from membership in this iterated product to a representation as a product of elements. I should look for lemmas related to big operators (like \\prod), cardinality of ordinals, and set products.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to big operators, cardinality of ordinals, and set products.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nbig_const:  forall (R : Type) (idx : R) (op : R -> R -> R) \n         (I : finType) (A : {pred I}) (x : R),\n       \\big[op/idx]_(i in A) x = iter #|A| (op x) idx\n\ncard_ord:  forall n : nat, #|\\'I_n| = n\n\nprodsgP:  reflect\n         (exists2 c : ?I -> ?gT,\n            forall i : ?I, ?P i -> c i \\in ?A i & ?x = \\prod_(i | ?P i) c i)\n         (?x \\in \\prod_(i | ?P i) ?A i)\nwhere\n?gT : [gT : finGroupType |- baseFinGroupType]\n?I : [gT : finGroupType |- finType]\n?P : [gT : finGroupType |- pred ?I]\n?A : [gT : finGroupType |- ?I -> {set ?gT}]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- BaseFinGroup.arg_sort ?gT]\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas are perfect:\n\n1. `big_const` allows us to rewrite an iterated operation over a constant value as a numeric iteration.\n\n2. `card_ord` gives us the cardinality of the ordinal type \\'I_n as n.\n\n3. `prodsgP` is especially useful, as it relates membership in a product of sets to the existence of a function whose values at each index are in the corresponding set, and whose product gives the element.\n\nI\\'ll use these to transform our goal. First, I\\'ll relate the iteration to a big operator using `big_const` and `card_ord`, then use `prodsgP` to get a function representation.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nrewrite -[n]card_ord -big_const => /prodsgP[/= c Ac def_x].\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\nc  : \\'I_n -> gT\nAc  : forall i : \\'I_n, i \\in \\'I_n -> c i \\in 1 |: A\ndef_x  : x = \\prod_(i in \\'I_n) c i\n|-exists n0 : nat,\n  exists2 c0 : \\'I_n0 -> gT,\n    forall i : \\'I_n0, c0 i \\in A & x = \\prod_(i < n0) c0 i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow we\\'re getting closer. We have a function c such that:\n- c maps from \\'I_n to gT\n- For all i in \\'I_n, c i is in (1 |: A), which means c i is either 1 or in A\n- x is the product of c i over all i in \\'I_n\n\nBut our goal requires a function where all values are in A (not 1 |: A). So we need to filter out those i where c i = 1, and only keep those where c i is in A.\n\nLet\\'s try to rewrite the product to only include those indices i where c i is in A, as the other factors (where c i = 1) don\\'t affect the product.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nhave{Ac def_x} ->: x = \\prod_(i | c i \\in A) c i.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\nc  : \\'I_n -> gT\nAc  : forall i : \\'I_n, i \\in \\'I_n -> c i \\in 1 |: A\ndef_x  : x = \\prod_(i in \\'I_n) c i\n|-x = \\prod_(i | c i \\in A) c i\nGoal 1\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\nc  : \\'I_n -> gT\n|-exists n0 : nat,\n  exists2 c0 : \\'I_n0 -> gT,\n    forall i : \\'I_n0, c0 i \\in A &\n    \\prod_(i | c i \\in A) c i = \\prod_(i < n0) c0 i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I have two subgoals:\n\n1. Show that x is equal to the product of c i for those i where c i is in A.\n2. Once we establish that, construct a new function that maps to exactly those elements of A.\n\nFor the first goal, I need to use properties of big operators and conditional expressions.

If c i \\in A, then the right side simplifies to c i. If c i \\not\\in A, then by the condition Ac, we know c i \\in 1 |: A, which means c i = 1.\n\nLet\\'s search for lemmas related to set membership in a union with singleton (1 |: A) and handling conditional expressions.\n</think>\n\n<search>\nFind lemmas related to set membership in a union with singleton and conditional expressions.\n</search>\n\n<result>\nif_same:  forall (A : Type) (b : bool) (vT : A), (if b then vT else vT) = vT\n\nisT:  true\n\nsetU1P:  reflect (?x = ?a \\/ ?x \\in ?B) (?x \\in ?a |: ?B)\nwhere\n?T : [gT : finGroupType |- finType]\n?x : [gT : finGroupType |- Finite.sort ?T]\n?a : [gT : finGroupType |- Finite.sort ?T]\n?B : [gT : finGroupType |- {set ?T}]\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThese lemmas will help:\n\n1. `if_same` says that if both branches of an if-then-else expression are the same, the result is just that value.\n\n2. `isT` is just the boolean value true.\n\n3. `setU1P` can transform membership in a union with singleton (x \\in a |: B) into \"x = a \\/ x \\in B\".\n\nI\\'ll use `setU1P` to break down c i \\in 1 |: A, then handle the two cases.\n</think>\n\n<script>\nby case/setU1P: (Ac i isT) => -> //; rewrite if_same.\n</script>\n\n<result>\nGoal 0\ngT  : finGroupType\nA  : {set gT}\nx  : gT\nn  : nat\nc  : \\'I_n -> gT\n|-exists n0 : nat,\n  exists2 c0 : \\'I_n0 -> gT,\n    forall i : \\'I_n0, c0 i \\in A &\n    \\prod_(i | c i \\in A) c i = \\prod_(i < n0) c0 i\n</result>\n\n<think>\nNow I\\'m left with the second goal.
