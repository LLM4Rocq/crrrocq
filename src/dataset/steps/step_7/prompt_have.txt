You are an AI theorem prover working in the Rocq/Coq proof assistant.
You have just used a semantic search tool to find a lemma/theorem needed for your proof, but the query you used did not return the correct result.

You are provided with:

    - The query you used (which was not successful)
    - The results returned by the tool (which did not match what you hoped for)

Your task:

Simulate a reasoning process where you analyze why your first query failed (in a form similar to a "think" block, but explaining what was missing or misleading in the query or in the tool’s interpretation, using only the information you have).  
Then, generate five new improved search queries that could better describe what you are looking for, strictly following the constraints below.

Constraints for each new search query:

    - Your query should describe what you are looking for or hoping to find, not the statement or docstring of any particular result.
    - Do not use the name or statement of any specific lemma/theorem; imagine you do not know them.
    - Make your query short and focused, as if you are searching a database for relevant results.

Output format:  
Your output should be a single code block, starting with your reasoning in a <think> ... </think> block, followed by five <search> ... </search> blocks (one per query).

Here is the input for your task:

    Wrong query: {wrong_query}
    Results: {first_result}

Please strictly follow this output template:

<think>
[Explain, in detail and in a negative/diagnostic form, why the previous query did not yield the desired result. Reference the given results to clarify the mismatch. Demonstrate a logical "debugging" process, identifying what the query missed or misunderstood, and how this leads you to reconsider your approach.]
</think>
<search>
[First improved query, concise and focused, not using any lemma names/statements.]
</search>
<search>
[Second improved query, concise and focused, not using any lemma names/statements.]
</search>
<search>
[Third improved query, concise and focused, not using any lemma names/statements.]
</search>
<search>
[Fourth improved query, concise and focused, not using any lemma names/statements.]
</search>
<search>
[Fifth improved query, concise and focused, not using any lemma names/statements.]
</search>

Remember:
- Use only the information provided above.
- Focus on the logical gap between what was returned and what you actually needed.
- The <think> section should be an honest internal monologue—diagnosing what went wrong and what you now realize you need to change to find the correct lemma.
- Make each <search> query plausible and meaningfully distinct.

Your think block should be short, containing maximum two to three short sentences.
