You are given two reasoning processes that attempt to extract a sequence of tactics (Rocq/Coq) from a lambda term. Your goal is to analyze both processes in detail and determine which one packs more useful insights and is more effective for learning and understanding the underlying problem.
First reasoning:

"{reasoning_1}"

Second reasoning

"{reasoning_2}"

Please proceed with a detailed, step-by-step analysis and then provide your conclusion on which reasoning process is more effective for understanding the underlying problem.
Finally, your answer should conclude with a final decision inside \boxed{{}} (either \boxed{{1}} if the first reasoning is more insightful, or \boxed{{2}} if the second reasoning is more insightful).
