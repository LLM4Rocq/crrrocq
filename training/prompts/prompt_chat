Below is a lambda term:
{term}

Your task is to generate a sequence of tactics in SSReflect (Coq/Rocq proof assistant) to generate a proof of this lemma.

Here are some constants that could be useful:
{constants}

And here are some notations that could be useful:
{notations}

Please carefully read the previous given elements, and deduce a sequence of tactics.
Think step by step, ensuring each tactic is justified by the structure of the lambda term and the available constants and notations.
Write directly the final sequence of tactics, and only tactics, between \boxed{{}}.
Example of expected output:
\boxed{{apply/exponentP=> _ /morphimP[x Dx Gx ->].
by rewrite -morphX // expg_exponent // morph1.}}

Don't write anything more than tactics inside \boxed{{}}
